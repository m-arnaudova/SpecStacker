Two-Dimensional Dust Maps
-------------------------


SFD
~~~

A two-dimensional map of dust reddening across the entire sky. The "SFD" dust
map is based on far-infrared emission of dust. The authors model the temperature
and optical depth of the dust, and then calibrate a relationship between the
dust's far-infrared optical depth and optical reddening. This calibration was
updated by
`Schlafly & Finkbeiner (2011) <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011ApJ...737..103S>`_.

In order to convert SFD values of E(B-V) to extinction, one should use the
conversions provided in
`Table 6 of Schlafly & Finkbeiner (2011) <http://iopscience.iop.org/0004-637X/737/2/103/article#apj398709t6>`_.

Lenz, Hensley & Doré (2017)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A two-dimensional map of dust reddening, covering 40% of the sky with a 16.1'
resolution. This map is derived from emission from low-velocity
(l.o.s. velocity < 90 km/s) HI, which is found to correlate much more strongly
with E(B-V) than emission from high-velocity HI. The underlying data comes from
the HI4PI Survey. This map reports E(B-V) in magnitudes.

Planck
~~~~~~

Two-dimensional maps of dust reddening across the entire sky. The
`Planck Collaboration (2013) <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014A%26A...571A..11P>`_
fits a modified blackbody dust emission model to the Planck and IRAS
far-infrared maps, and provides three different conversions to dust reddening.

The three maps provided by
`Planck Collaboration (2013) <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014A%26A...571A..11P>`_
are based on:

#. τ\ :sub:`353`\ : dust optical depth at 353 GHz.
#. ℛ: thermal dust radiance.
#. A recommended extragalactic reddening estimate, based on thermal dust
   radiance, but with point sources removed.

Peek & Graves (2010)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A correction to the SFD'98 dust map, based on color excess measurements of "standard crayons" -- spectroscopically selected passively evolving galaxies. The maps have an angular resolution of 4.5°, and have a 1σ uncertainty of 1.5 mmag in E(B-V). Subtract this map from SFD'98 to obtain the corrected E(B-V) reddening.

Burstein & Heiles
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Primarily of historical interest, the
`Burstein & Heiles (1982) <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1982AJ.....87.1165B>`_
dust reddening maps are derived from HI column density and galaxy counts.

Three-Dimensional Dust Maps
---------------------------


Bayestar
~~~~~~~~

A three-dimensional map of Milky Way dust reddening, covering the three quarters
of the sky north of a declination of -30°. The map is probabilistic. containing
samples of the reddening along each line of sight. The "Bayestar" dust map is
inferred from stellar photometry of 800 million stars observed by Pan-STARRS 1,
and 2MASS photometry for a quarter of the stars. The latest version of Bayestar
also makes use of *Gaia* DR2 parallaxes.

There are three versions of Bayestar, called *Bayestar19*, *Bayestar17* and
*Bayestar15* here. By default, :code:`dustmaps` will use the latest version,
Bayestar19, although the earlier versions of the map can be selected by providing
the keyword argument :code:`version='bayestar2017'` or :code:`version='bayestar2015'`
in routines such as :code:`dustmaps.bayestar.fetch`,
:code:`dustmaps.bayestar.BayestarQuery` and :code:`dustmaps.bayestar.BayestarWebQuery`.
If you want to make sure that your code will always use the same version of the
map, even as new versions of Bayestar are released, then set the :code:`version`
keyword explicitly.

The units of reddening used by each map are slightly different:

#. Bayestar19 reports reddening in an arbitrary unit that can be converted to
   extinction in different bands using the coefficients given in Table 1 of
   Green, Schlafly, Finkbeiner et al. (2019).
#. Bayestar17 reports reddening in an arbitrary unit that can be converted to
   extinction in different bands using the coefficients given in Table 1 of
   `Green, Schlafly, Finkbeiner et al. (2018) <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018arXiv180103555G>`_.
#. Bayestar15 reports reddening in the same units as those used by SFD. Therefore,
   in order to convert Bayestar15 reddenings to extinction in different bands, one
   should use the conversions provided in
   `Table 6 of Schlafly & Finkbeiner (2011) <http://iopscience.iop.org/0004-637X/737/2/103/article#apj398709t6>`_.

Chen et al. (2014)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A three-dimensional map of dust extinction in the Galactic anticenter. The map
covers about 6000 deg\ :sup:`2`\ , from 140° < ℓ < 240° and -60° < b < 40°, and
